# Kruse_CSCI2270_FinalProject
CSCI 2270 final project.

Phase 1 - Description:
A game of battleship played in the terminal. Program will use a linked list with nodes that designate locations of battleships and whether or not a node has been struck or not. A class will handle all methods related to storing coordinates and battleship properties (e.g. size, damaged/intact coordinates, print coordinate map). A driver file will handle other properties, such as the main menu, and certain functionalities such as receiving user input to determine which functions to call in class.
